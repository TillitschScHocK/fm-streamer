# FM Streamer



# Setup / Usage

(optional) Install [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli). This project is set up to work out of the box with it, and this will save you having to set up the ESP8266 in your Arduino IDE.

Run `arduino-cli core update-index`
arduino-cli core install esp8266:esp8266


Rename `arduino_secrets.h.example` to `arduino_secrets.h` and change the wifi SSID and password in it to match the network you wish to attach to.
